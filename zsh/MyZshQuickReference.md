My ZSH Quick Reference:
=======================

Autojump
* j <partialFolderName> - Jump to the most recent folder that matches the partial folder name

FZF - a fuzzy finder (like CtrlP for the shell):
* fzf - opens a program to find a file and returns its name in stdout
* fzf -m - open in multiselect mode
* ** <TAB> - Will open FZF to search for the wildcarded item (files and folders, pids, host names, environmental variables)
* ESC or Ctrl-C - Exit

Sudo
* Esc - Esc - will prepend the current command with sudo
* _ - is aliased to sudo
